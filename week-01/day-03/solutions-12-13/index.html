Problem 12


All `input` elements can be validated using the pattern attribute. This attribute expects a case sensitive Regular Expression as its value. If the element's value is not empty and doesn't match the regular expression specified by the pattern attribute, the element is considered invalid.

Here is an example :

On HTML

<form>
  <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or a cherry?</label>
  <input id="choose" name="i_like" pattern="banana|cherry">
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>

On CSS

input:invalid {
  border: 1px solid red;
}

input:valid {
  border: 1px solid green;
}
